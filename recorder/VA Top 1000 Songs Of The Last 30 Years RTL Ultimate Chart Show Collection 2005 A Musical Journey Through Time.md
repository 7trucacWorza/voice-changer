If you are looking for a small and light Windows tablet that can also double as a digital note-taking and sketching device, you might want to check out the Toshiba Encore 2 Write WT8PE-B264. This 8-inch tablet comes with a Wacom Active ES pen that offers precise and pressure-sensitive input, as well as some useful apps from Toshiba and Microsoft. In this review, we will take a closer look at the features, performance, and pros and cons of this tablet.
 
## Features
 
The Toshiba Encore 2 Write WT8PE-B264 has an 8-inch IPS display with a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels. The screen is bright and clear, with good viewing angles and touch responsiveness. The tablet also has a micro HDMI port that allows you to connect it to an external monitor or TV.

The tablet is powered by an Intel Atom Z3735F processor with 2 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage. The processor is not very powerful, but it can handle basic tasks like web browsing, email, social media, and video streaming. The storage space can be expanded with a micro SD card slot that supports up to 128 GB cards.
 
The tablet comes with Windows 8.1 with Bing, which is a slightly modified version of Windows 8.1 that has Bing as the default search engine and some pre-installed apps from Microsoft and Toshiba. The tablet also comes with a free one-year subscription to Office 365 Personal, which gives you access to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and 1 TB of OneDrive cloud storage.
 
The main attraction of this tablet is the Wacom Active ES pen that is included in the box. The pen has a thin and light design, with two buttons on the side and an eraser on the top. The pen uses a battery that can last up to a year. The pen works seamlessly with the tablet's screen, offering accurate and smooth input with 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity. The pen also works with Windows Ink Workspace, which is a feature that lets you access various apps and tools for writing, drawing, and annotating on the screen.
 
The tablet also comes with some apps from Toshiba that are designed to enhance the pen experience. These include TruNote, which is a note-taking app that lets you write, draw, record audio, and sync your notes to the cloud; TruCapture, which is an app that lets you capture images of documents, whiteboards, or receipts and convert them into editable notes; TruRecorder, which is an app that lets you record audio and transcribe it into text; and TruPen, which is an app that lets you customize the pen settings.
 
## Performance
 
The Toshiba Encore 2 Write WT8PE-B264 is not a powerhouse tablet, but it can handle most everyday tasks without much lag or stuttering. The tablet boots up quickly and runs smoothly on Windows 8.1. The tablet can also run some casual games like Candy Crush Saga or Angry Birds Star Wars without any issues.
 
The tablet's battery life is decent, but not outstanding. The tablet can last up to 8 hours on a single charge, depending on your usage. The tablet also supports fast charging, which can give you up to 50% of battery in 30 minutes.
 
The tablet's speakers are located on the bottom edge of the device. They are loud enough for watching videos or listening to music in a quiet room, but they lack bass and clarity. You might want to use headphones or external speakers for a better audio experience.
