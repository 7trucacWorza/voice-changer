
 
At CLS, we stand in solidarity with our LGBTQIA+ staff members, clients, and community members in Colorado Springs and across the state and the country during this difficult and painful time. We are outraged by the acts of violence and hatred that target spaces that should be safe and welcoming for everyone. We cannot let ourselves become desensitized or immobilized by the current patterns of violence. We must continue to fight for the human right of every person to love who they want and to live a full life of joy, safety, and freedom.
  
We know that the LGBTQIA+ community faces many challenges and barriers in accessing justice, health care, education, employment, and other basic rights and services. We also know that the LGBTQIA+ community is resilient and diverse, and that it has many strengths and assets. We are proud to work with and for the LGBTQIA+ community, and we are committed to providing culturally responsive and inclusive services that meet their needs and respect their dignity.

We also recognize that we have a responsibility to educate ourselves and others about the issues and experiences of the LGBTQIA+ community, and to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that fuel discrimination and violence. We invite you to join us in this effort by learning more about the LGBTQIA+ community, supporting LGBTQIA+ organizations and events, and speaking up against hate and injustice whenever you encounter them.
  
Together, we can create a more just and compassionate society where everyone can live authentically and freely. Together, we can honor the lives and memories of those who have been lost to violence and celebrate the diversity and beauty of the LGBTQIA+ community. Together, we can make a difference.
