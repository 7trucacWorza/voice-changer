One of the highlights of this library is the StrumMaker III engine, which allows you to create your own custom strumming patterns using a simple grid editor. You can also choose from a variety of preset patterns and styles, and adjust the speed, swing, accent, and humanization. StrumMaker III also lets you play chords with one key, or use the chord detection mode to play them with two keys. You can also use keyswitches to trigger different articulations, such as slides, mutes, harmonics, and more.
 
Another feature that adds realism and expression to this library is the Auto-Vibrato function, which automatically applies vibrato to sustained notes based on the velocity and duration. You can also control the amount and speed of vibrato manually using the mod wheel. Additionally, this library includes guitar body impulse responses, which simulate the resonance and sound of the acoustic guitar body. You can choose from different IRs for each guitar, or load your own custom IRs.
