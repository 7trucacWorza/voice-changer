## How to Use the Style to Keyboard Set Button on Your Korg Pa Keyboard
  
One of the features that makes the Korg Pa keyboards so versatile and powerful is the Style to Keyboard Set button. This button allows you to link a keyboard set to a style variation, or to recall the first keyboard set with a given style. A keyboard set is a combination of sounds and settings that you can assign to the upper and lower parts of your keyboard. A style is a collection of rhythmic and harmonic patterns that you can play along with. A style variation is a different version of a style that changes the intensity, complexity, or mood of the patterns.
