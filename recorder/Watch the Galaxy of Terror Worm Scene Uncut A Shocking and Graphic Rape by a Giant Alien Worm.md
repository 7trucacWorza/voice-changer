Galaxy of Terror is a 1981 science fiction horror film produced by Roger Corman and directed by Bruce D. Clark. The film follows a group of space explorers who crash-land on a mysterious planet where they face their worst fears manifested by an alien device. One of the most notorious scenes in the film involves a female crew member, played by Taaffe O'Connell, who is attacked and raped by a giant worm-like creature.
 
The scene was controversial for its graphic depiction of sexual violence and its apparent exploitation of the actress. O'Connell later said that she felt humiliated and violated by the filming process, which involved being covered in slime and having a rubber worm wrapped around her body. She also claimed that Corman added more nudity and gore to the scene without her consent. The scene was cut or censored in some countries, but it also gained a cult following among fans of B-movies and exploitation cinema.

The worm scene has been analyzed by critics and scholars as an example of the misogyny and rape culture in horror films, as well as a reflection of the anxieties and fantasies of the male-dominated genre. Some have argued that the scene is a subversive commentary on the sexual politics of the 1980s, while others have dismissed it as a cheap and gratuitous shock tactic. The scene has also been compared to other infamous scenes of sexual violence in films such as Alien (1979), The Thing (1982), and The Fly (1986).
 
Whether one views the worm scene as a masterpiece or a monstrosity, there is no denying that it is one of the most memorable and disturbing moments in the history of science fiction horror cinema.

Galaxy of Terror has also been recognized as an influential film in the science fiction horror genre, especially for its visual style and production design. The film was one of the early works of James Cameron, who served as the second unit director and special effects supervisor. Cameron later went on to direct some of the most successful and acclaimed films in the genre, such as The Terminator (1984), Aliens (1986), and Avatar (2009). He also hired some of his Galaxy of Terror crew members for his future projects, such as production designer Bill Paxton and composer James Horner.
 
The film has also inspired other filmmakers who have borrowed or paid homage to its plot and themes. One of the most notable examples is Event Horizon (1997), which also features a group of space explorers who encounter a mysterious device that creates their worst nightmares. Other films that have been compared to Galaxy of Terror include Pitch Black (2000), Pandorum (2009), and Prometheus (2012).
