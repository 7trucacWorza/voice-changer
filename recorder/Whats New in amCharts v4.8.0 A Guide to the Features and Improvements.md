You can enable accessibility features by setting `accessible = true` on your chart or map instance.

These themes are based on color palettes created by Kelly Norton and Paul Tol respectively, and they provide a fresh and vibrant look for your data visualization. To use these themes, you need to import them from the @amcharts/amcharts4/themes package and apply them to your chart or map instance[^1^].

## Performance Improvements
 
amCharts v4.8.0 also includes some performance improvements that make your charts and maps faster and smoother. For example, the library now uses a more efficient way of rendering SVG elements, which reduces the number of DOM nodes and improves the rendering speed. The library also uses a smarter way of handling animations, which avoids unnecessary calculations and redraws. These improvements can make a noticeable difference, especially for complex charts and maps with many elements[^1^].
 
## Compatibility and Migration
 
amCharts v4 is compatible with most modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and IE11.

If you are upgrading from a previous version of amCharts 4, you can check the changelog[^1^] to see what has changed and what you need to do to migrate your code. If you are migrating from amCharts 3 or earlier, you need to be aware that amCharts 4 is a completely new product with a different architecture and API. You will need to rewrite your code to use the new features and syntax of amCharts 4. However, this also means that you can take advantage of the new capabilities and possibilities that amCharts 4 offers. To help you with the migration process, you can use the migration guide[^1^] and the migration tool[^1^] that are available on the documentation website.
