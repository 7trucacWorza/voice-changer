- Learn the controls: The game can be played with either a keyboard or a controller. You can move Isaac with the WASD keys or the left analog stick, and shoot tears in four directions with the arrow keys or the right analog stick. You can also use bombs, items, pills and tarot cards with different buttons or keys. You can check the default controls in the options menu or change them to your preference.
- Explore the map: Each floor of the basement has a randomly generated layout with different rooms that can contain enemies, items, shops, secrets and more. You can see a mini-map on the top right corner of the screen that shows you where you have been and where you can go. Try to explore as much as possible to find useful resources and secrets that can help you in your journey.
- Collect items: Items are one of the most important aspects of the game, as they can drastically change your stats, appearance and abilities. There are hundreds of items in the game, each with different effects and synergies. You can find items in treasure rooms, boss rooms, shops, secret rooms, chests and more. Some items are passive, meaning they work automatically once you pick them up, while others are active, meaning you have to use them with a button or key. You can only carry one active item at a time, so choose wisely.
- Manage your resources: In addition to items, you will also need coins, bombs and keys to access certain rooms and buy things from shops. These resources are limited and sometimes hard to find, so use them wisely and don't waste them. You can also trade your health for other resources in certain rooms, such as devil deals or curse rooms. This can be risky but also rewarding if you know what you are doing.
- Know your enemies: The game has a large variety of enemies that can attack you in different ways. Some enemies are fast, some are slow, some shoot projectiles, some explode, some chase you, some hide and more. You need to learn their patterns and behaviors to avoid taking damage and defeat them efficiently. You also need to be prepared for boss fights at the end of each floor, which are usually harder and have more health than regular enemies.

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth 1.041 is a game that will keep you entertained for hours with its endless replay value and randomness. It is also a game that will challenge you and make you frustrated at times with its high difficulty and unpredictability. But if you follow these tips and tricks, you will have a better chance of surviving and having fun with this game.
