## Step 4: Create a Scene
 
A scene is a unit of gameplay in TyranoBuilder. A scene consists of a background image, one or more characters, dialogue, sound effects, music, and other elements that make up a visual novel. To create a scene, we need to use the Game Editor, which is the main interface for making games with TyranoBuilder.
 
The Game Editor has three main parts: the Scene List, the Scene Editor, and the Component List. The Scene List shows all the scenes in your game project. The Scene Editor shows the current scene and allows you to edit it. The Component List shows all the components that you can use to create your scene, such as images, text, buttons, etc.
 
To create a new scene, click on the "New Scene" button at the bottom of the Scene List. A new scene will be added to your project and opened in the Scene Editor. You can rename your scene by double-clicking on its name in the Scene List. For this tutorial, let's name our scene "Intro".
 
## Step 5: Add a Background Image
 
The first thing we want to do is to add a background image to our scene. A background image is an image that fills the entire screen and sets the mood and atmosphere of your game. To add a background image, we need to use the "Background" component from the Component List.
 
Drag and drop the "Background" component from the Component List to the Scene Editor. A window will pop up that allows you to select an image file for your background. You can use any image file that is stored in your project folder or import a new image file from your computer. For this tutorial, let's use one of the sample images that come with TyranoBuilder. Click on the "Select Image" button and browse to "data/bgimage/". Select "school.jpg" and click "OK". You will see your background image appear in the Scene Editor.
 
## Step 6: Add a Character
 
The next thing we want to do is to add a character to our scene. A character is an image that represents a person or an animal in your game. To add a character, we need to use the "Character" component from the Component List.
 
Drag and drop the "Character" component from the Component List to the Scene Editor. A window will pop up that allows you to select an image file for your character. You can use any image file that is stored in your project folder or import a new image file from your computer. For this tutorial, let's use one of the sample images that come with TyranoBuilder. Click on the "Select Image" button and browse to "data/fgimage/". Select "chara\_01.png" and click "OK". You will see your character appear in the Scene Editor.
